== Introduction

This GitHub App is based on the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-github-app[Quarkus GitHub App framework].

It can be run as a native executable.

== Current Actions

=== Check pull request editorial rules

This action checks that the title of a pull request respects some editorial rules to make Release Notes more consistent.

=== Triage issues

Based on the `.github/quarkus-bot.yml` file, this rule affects labels to issues and also pings the appropriate people.

Syntax of the `.github/quarkus-bot.yml` file is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
triage:
  rules:
    - labels: [area/amazon-lambda]
      title: "lambda"
      notify: [patriot1burke, matejvasek]
      directories:
        - extensions/amazon-lambda
        - integration-tests/amazon-lambda
    - labels: [area/persistence]
      title: "db2"
      notify: [aguibert]
      directories:
        - extensions/reactive-db2-client/
        - extensions/jdbc/jdbc-db2/
----

For issues, each rule can be triggered by:

* `title` - if the title matches this regular expression (case insensitively), trigger the rule
* `body` - if the body (i.e. description) matches this regular expression (case insensitively), trigger the rule
* `titleBody` - if either the title or the body (i.e. description) match this regular expression (case insensitively), trigger the rule
* `expression` - allows to write a Jakarta EL expression testing `title`, `body` or `titleBody`. Be careful when writing expressions, better ping `@gsmet` in the pull request when creating/updating an expression.

[TIP]
====
When writing expressions, you can use the `matches(String pattern, String string)` function that behaves as follows:

[source,java]
----
public static boolean matches(String pattern, String string) {
    return Pattern.compile(".*" + pattern + ".*", Pattern.DOTALL | Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE).matcher(string)
            .matches();
}
----

A rule using an expression based on `matches()` would look like:

[source,yaml]
----
    - labels: [area/hibernate-orm, area/persistence]
      expression: |
              matches("hibernate", title)
              && !matches("hibernate.validator", title)
              && !matches("hibernate.search", title)
              && !matches("hibernate.reactive", title)
      notify: [gsmet, Sanne, yrodiere]
----
====

If the rule is triggered, the following actions will be executed:

* `notify` - will create a comment pinging the users listed in the array
* `labels` - will add the labels to the issue

=== Triage pull requests

The pull requests triage action uses the same configuration file as the issues triage action.

There are a few differences though as it doesn't behave in the exact same way.

For pull requests, each rule can be triggered by:

* `directories` - if any file in the commits of the pull requests match, trigger the rule. This is not a regexp (it uses `startsWith`) but glob type expression are supported too `extensions/test/**`.

If the rule is triggered, the following action will be executed:

* `labels` - will add the labels to the issue
* `notify` - will create a comment pinging the users listed in the array **only if `notifyInPullRequest` is true**

=== Notify QE

When the `triage/qe?` label is added to an issue or a pull request, the QE team is pinged.

The configuration is done in the `quarkus-bot.yml` config file:

[source,yaml]
----
triage:
  qe:
    notify: [rsvoboda, mjurc]
----

=== Affect milestones

When a pull request is merged, if it targets the `main` branch, it affects the milestone ending with ` - main` to the pull request and the issues resolved by the pull request (e.g. `Fixes #1234`).

It only affects the milestone is no milestone has been affected prior to the merge.
If the milestone cannot be affected, we add a comment to the pull request indicating the items for which we haven't affected the milestone.

=== Workflow run report

When a workflow run associated to a pull request is completed, a report is generated and added as a comment in the pull request:

> image::documentation/screenshots/workflow-run-report.png[]

=== Mark closed pull requests as invalid

If a pull request is closed without being merged, we automatically add the `triage/invalid` label to the pull request.

=== Automatically remove outdated labels

The bot will automatically remove these labels when they are outdated:

* `triage/needs-triage` from closed issues
* `waiting-for-ci` from closed pull requests

== Contributing

To participate to the development of this GitHub App, create a playground project in your own org and
follow the steps outlined in https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-github-app/dev/index.html[the Quarkus GitHub App documentation].

GitHub permissions required:

* Issues - `Read & Write`
* Pull Requests - `Read & Write`
* Contents - `Read`

By default, in dev mode, the Bot runs in dry-run so it's logging its actions but do not perform them.
You can override this behavior by adding `_DEV_QUARKUS_BOT_DRY_RUN=false` to your `.env` file.

== Deployment

Once logged in to the OpenShift cluster (using `oc login...`), just run:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./deploy-to-openshift.sh
----
